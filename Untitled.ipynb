The poll gauged opinions of Bharat users ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021. This year, BCCI is the host of the tournament in the UAE. Cricket stadiums of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah will host the matches of the ICC event. Some matches of round 1 will take place in Oman.</p><p>\\xa0</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p><strong>Key Highlights</strong></p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>\\xa0</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p><strong>World Cup promises excitement</strong></p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>The majority of respondents have expressed their excitement about the mega event. About 53% of participants revealed their excitement for the World Cup that is being held just days after India’s own cricket festival, the IPL. While 67% believe that IPL as a precursor to the World Cup will be advantageous for the Indian team, a little over 18% have expressed otherwise.</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>The upcoming World Cup not just gauged the country’s excitement level but the undying faith in Team India too. Almost 60% of the respondents believe India will definitely bring the trophy home. Nearly 25% said the winning chances are 80-90% while a minority of 10.5% believe the chances are below 50%.\\xa0</p><p>\\xa0</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p><strong>Under Dhoni’s Wing</strong></p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>Dhoni, who recently led his team Chennai Super Kings to victory at the IPL has joined Team India’s camp in the UAE. Captain Virat Kohli himself has extended his support to the former skipper who brought home the 2013 World Championship Trophy. “He has got massive experience. He is quite excited himself. He has always been a mentor for all of us. Younger guys who are playing their first major tournaments at early stages of career will benefit,” Kohli was quoted as saying by a news agency.</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>When asked if Dhoni’s guidance will help, respondents look fairly optimistic. Almost 65% strongly believe Dhoni’s presence will improve the team’s performance, while further 19% also registered their agreement with the thought. About 16% of the respondents strongly/somewhat believe that Dhoni’s guidance won’t help.\\xa0</p><p>\\xa0</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p><strong>The World of Worthy Opponents\\xa0</strong></p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p><p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p>When it comes to competition, the respondents registered an array of opinions.

Interestingly, India marked its iconic win at the 2007 T20 WC when the men in blue defeated Pak by 5 runs in the final match.
